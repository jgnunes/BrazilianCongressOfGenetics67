Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10x Genomics Linked-Reads sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the Wellcome Sanger Institute on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq (10x) instruments. Hi-C data were generated from gill tissue using the Arima v2.0 kit and sequenced on a NovaSeq instrument. All sequencing DNA was extracted from a single female specimen.
